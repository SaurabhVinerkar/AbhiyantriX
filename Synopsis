#Problem Being Solved
>We are aware of several bank robberies like circumstances under which armed person(s) in a premises can cause severe harm for bank and our customers.
>After investigation, it turns out to; if had taken a proactive & reactive measures, such incidents could have been dealt optimally.
>Hence, the aim is to develop a better reactive mechanism through Video analytics, wherein  scenarios vis-à-vis, 
     #Suspicious Activities
     #Hazardous Objects being brought into the premises.
     #Break / Interruption in footage
     #Tampering with the cameras / sensitive or high priority area within premises
     #Any activity that needs attention
     #Fire / Theft related incident taking place
can be identified through the video analysis and an alarm can be raised to the surveillance/control room as well as the nearest police station if configured.



#Approach taken to create the model
>In order to achieve the main goal of video analytics that is to automatically recognize temporal and spatial events in videos footage, it has been planned to implement several Deep Learning & AI algorithm modules which leverages existing video surveillance networks to derive searchable, actionable, and quantifiable intelligence from live or recorded video footage.


#Reason why your solution should be considered:-
>We understand the eagerness of the need for such technological solutions; which if implemented, can solve several problems and upholds the technical supremacy in the banking world.
>Our solution incorporating with a boost can actually be helpful for those who urges it in ground level. Hence, kindly request you to consider our project.
